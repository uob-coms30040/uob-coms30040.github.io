## Welcome

Welcome to the home of *COMS30040: Types and Lambda Calculus*.  This unit introduces you to type theory and the pure lambda calculus, which are two hugely influential parts of logic and the theory of programming languages.  

In our 10 credit unit, we will be looking at one slice through these two subjects, and our focus will be on the *expressive power* of the language with and without types; the *algorithmics* of assigning types to terms; and the close *correspondence* with logic and proof.  A secondary goal is to teach you to write mathematical proofs.

This unit prepares you for *COMSM0067: Advanced Topics in Programming Languages* in the programming languages theme in your fourth year, but is not a prerequesite.  It shares themes and techniques with the unit *MATH30100: Logic*.

## Schedule

*See [detailed schedule](schedule.html) for a comprehensive week-by-week synopsis.*

You should expect to spend around *7 hours per week* working on this unit.  There are 4 main activities:
  * __Lectures (3 hr).__ There are two *core lectures* and one *supplementary lecture* each week.  For those of you able to attend, the core lectures will be given in-person on campus, and are listed in your timetable as "seminar":  
      - Tuesday 4pm in the Ada Lovelace Building SM3
      - Wednesday noon in Queens 1.69

    For those of you who are not able to attend, pre-recorded videos covering the same material are released every Sunday at midnight (you may ignore the "seminar" timetable slots).  The supplementary lecture is only available as a video.  Material covered supplementary lecture is not assessed and so can be considered optional, but is highly recommended.
  
  * __Problem Sheets (2-3 hr).__ You will only learn on this unit by completing the problem sheets.  There is one sheet released each week.  You should aim to spend *at least two hours* on each problem sheet each week.  You will need to consult the course [lecture notes](assets/notes.pdf){: target="_blank" } and/or [supplementary notes](assets/proofs.pdf){: target="_blank" } whilst attempting the problems.  You should complete the problem sheet in your own time and submit it to Eddie Jones at ej16147@bristol.ac.uk no later than the following Tuesday at midday.  Eddie and Sam will mark your work and return it to you in time for your problem class.

  * __Problem Class (1 hr).__ Excepting Week 1, you should attend a problem class each week to discuss the answers to the problems of the previous week.  Unless everyone can make it in-person, we will likely run one problem class in person and one problem class online, simultaneously.
     - Friday 2pm in either Ada Lovelace SM3/SM4 or online (TBD)
   
  * __Office Hours (<1 hr).__ Steven will be running office hours at a convenient time.

## Navigating the course

The unit is distributed over three locations:

* This [blackboard page][bb], which contains:
    - the [welcome page](welcome.html), listing administrative information about the unit
    - the [detailed schedule](schedule.html), which links to the videos, the problem sheets and their solutions
    - the [discussion board](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_247691_1&tool_id=_2827_1&tool_type=TOOL&mode=cpview&mode=reset), for discussion, question and answer about the material
    - the [assessment point](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_5946070_1&course_id=_247691_1&mode=reset) where you will take your final exam

* The [lecture notes][rf]{: target="_blank" }, which contains a comprehensive and authoritative reference for all the material introduced in the core lectures: you will need to refer to this when completing the problems. 

* The [supplementary notes][sn]{: target="_blank" }, which contains a reference to the material on proofs as a form of programming that is introduced in the supplementary lectures of weeks 1 and 2.
