## :wave: Welcome

Welcome to the home of *COMS30040: Types and Lambda Calculus*.  This unit introduces you to the mathematical foundations of programming languages, with an emphasis on functional programs and type systems.  

Our focus will be on the *expressive power* of the language with and without types; the *algorithmics* of assigning types to terms; and the close *correspondence* with logic and proof.  A secondary goal is to teach you to write mathematical proofs.

This unit prepares you for *COMSM0067: Advanced Topics in Programming Languages* in the programming languages theme in your fourth year, but is not a prerequesite.  It shares themes and techniques with the unit *MATH30100: Logic*.

The unit is run by [Steven Ramsay][1] (lectures) and Luna Abumatar, Amos Holland, Tomos Sherlock and Tom Divers (classes).

Outside of lectures and classes, if you have any questions about the material, the way the unit runs or are just curious about programming language theory or logic more generally, then please post to the General channel of the [Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AmqnhGdYxFVZnIkAmCpOFOnM_OjWSvbtbcQwIzAA4gg81%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=afade0de-43f6-49e7-9b2c-f875492929a1&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b){: target="_blank" }.  We would like to hear from you!

## :date: Schedule

You should expect to spend around *6-7 hours per week* working on this unit.

  * __Lectures (2 hr).__ Excepting Week 1 (which has an additional Monday lecture), There are two lectures per week, given on campus:
      - Monday at 4pm in Queens 1.06
      - Thursday at 2pm in Queens 1.18
    
    Each lecture corresponds to one chapter in the lecture notes (see above).
 
  * __Problem Sheets (3 hr).__ You will only learn by completing the problem sheets.  There is one sheet released each week.  You should aim to spend *at least two hours* working on each problem sheet each week, in your own time.  You will need to consult the course [lecture notes](assets/notes.pdf){: target="_blank" } whilst attempting the problems.  You should complete the Week n problem sheet and submit it no later than the end of the (following) Monday of Week (n+1).
  
      *Attempting the problem sheets each week is the single most important thing to do in this unit.  One can certainly excel without attending a single lecture, but not doing the problems will lead to certain disaster.*

<!-- Please submit your work by email with subject "[TLC] Week N", where N is the number of the week containing the deadline (usually this will be the current week).  So, the first sheet should be submitted with subject "[TLC] Week 2".  To see who you should submit it to, consult your timetable:

- If you are in Group 1 (Ada Lovelace SM4), please email (a scan/photo/image/pdf) to Amos Holland (amos.holland.2021).
- If you are in Group 2 (Ada Lovelace SM3), please email (a scan/photo/image/pdf) to Rose Hudson (cv21874).
- If you are in Group 3 (Ada Lovelace PC6), please email (a scan/photo/image/pdf) to Charlie Walpole (op18921). -->
    
  * __Problem Class (1 hr).__ You should attend a problem class each week to discuss the answers to the problems of the previous week and look ahead to problems of the next week.  There will be no class in Week 1, since you have not yet had time to complete a problem sheet.
     - Friday 2pm in Ada Lovelace SM3/SM4/PC6
   
  * __Office Hours (0-1 hr).__ Starting from Week 2, Steven will be running office hours every Tuesday from 12noon-1pm in his office, MVB 2.46.  
  
<!-- The TAs will be running office hours every Friday from 4pm-5pm in their office, 81 Woodland Rd, room 1.05: opposite MVB, the staircase next to the bus stop, go up the stairs, all the way into the garden, then Sam will let you in the back door. -->
