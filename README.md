# Webpages Source Repository

The repository contains the source code for the unit webpages that are hosted on Blackboard.  Pushing to this repository automatically invokes a Github runner to build the pages and mirror them onto the `site/` subdirectory of the course content area on Blackboard.

Course materials are populated automatically from the [materials](https://github.com/uob-coms30040/materials) repository.

The detailed schedule page is generated from the [weeks](_data/weeks.yml) file.
