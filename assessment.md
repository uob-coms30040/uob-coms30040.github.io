## :100: December Exam

The unit is 100% assessed by one section in the written exam "Topics in Computer Science" in the December exam period.

<!-- For this year, you will be able to take one A4 page (= one side of a sheet of A4 paper) of your own notes into the exam and consult them freely.   -->

The exam is _closed book_, you may not bring any notes with you to the exam room.  However, at the back of the Types and Lambda Calculus section in the exam is an appendix containing most of the important definitions from the unit.  You can take a look at what was provided last year here: [appendix](papers/appendix.pdf).

The exam is a series of problems to solve in the same style as the weekly problem sheets. There will be one question, split into several parts that are worth a total of 50 marks.  The problems are of varying difficulty and  the difficulty is labelled on each question.  The difficulty of problems is related to your possible marks in *roughly* the following way:

* 1* problems only account for approximately 40% of available marks.
* 1* and 2* problems account for approximately 70% of available marks.
* 1\*, 2\* and 3* problems account for approximately 100% of available marks.

Typical examples of 1* questions (mostly mechanical derivations, using definitions carefully but with little insight):
* Identifying a correct use of a definition, e.g. that some reduction is correct.
* Identifying parts of terms/types/derivations, e.g. list all free variables/redexes in a given term.
* Giving simple examples of e.g. reductions, normal forms, types etc.
* Constructing type derivations to justify a type assignment.
* Constructing terms that inhabit a given type.

Typical examples of 2* questions (mostly proofs that are of a similar shape to those you have been doing routinely - do not require any tricks or difficult insights):
* Prove that a term satisfies a property, e.g that a term implements the square function on numerals.
* Prove a property of all terms, all reduction sequences, all types etc. typically using induction.
* Prove that no term exists that satisfies a given property/specification.
* Prove that a term is untypable.
* Give an example of a term satisfying a given complex specification.

*Before the day of the exam, ensure you are confident in how to answer typical 1\* and 2\* questions!*

<!-- _The last part of the first question (on untyped PCF) is a 4* question, do not attempt it until you have done all you can on all other question parts_.  In general, the difficulty of problems increases throughout each of the two questions - the last problem of Question 1 is very difficult, but the first problem of Question 2 should be easy. -->

<!-- Note that Chapter 9 of the notes, on decidability and undecidability is not examined (since I did not have time to cover it in lectures).  The last two sections of the last chapter, 13.3 and 13.4 are not examined either. -->

Below you will find a selection of past papers and their answers.  HOWEVER, before 2024 the exam was a different format: it was a 2 hour exam dedicated to Types and Lambda Calculus and questions were not labelled with their difficulty.  Now, Types and Lambda Calculus just forms one section in the 2 hour "Topics in Computer Science" exam.  Therefore, each of the past papers below contains roughly twice as many problems as you will need to solve in your exam.  Note, you will also typically find the older "past papers" more difficult than the real exam, because what you have been taught differs from what has been taught in previous iterations of the unit.  For example, in previous years, students had much more practice with pure terms (PCF without constants, as in Problem Sheet 5).
